Title: Spatial Pattern Recognition via Kernels
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2020-02-08
Author: Shiquan Sun, Jiaqiang Zhu, and Xiang Zhou
Maintainer: Jiaqiang Zhu <jiaqiang@umich.edu>
Description: SPARK is an efficient tool for identifying spatial expression patterns. SPARK directly models raw count data generated from various spatial resolved transcriptomic techniques. With a new efficient penalized quasi-likelihood based algorithm, SPARK is scalable to data sets with tens of thousands of genes measured on tens of thousands of samples.
